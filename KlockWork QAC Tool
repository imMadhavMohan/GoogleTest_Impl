Klocwork is a Static Code Analysis Tool used mainly in automotive, aerospace, embedded systems, and safety-critical software to detect defects, vulnerabilities, and compliance issues in C, C++, C#, Java, Python, and other languages before
runtime.
üîç What Klocwork Does

Static Code Analysis ‚Äî examines source code without executing it.

Detects:
Memory leaks, null pointer dereferences, Uninitialized var, Segmentation fault
Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds access
Concurrency issues (race conditions, deadlocks)
MISRA C/C++ and AUTOSAR C++14 rule violations
Security vulnerabilities (e.g., CWE, CERT)
Integrates with:
IDEs (Visual Studio, Eclipse, CLion)
Build systems (Make, CMake, Bazel)
CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps)
Generates detailed reports with code location, defect description, and remediation guidance.

üí° Why Automotive Teams Use It
Meets ISO 26262 (functional safety) compliance.
Ensures MISRA C/C++ adherence for safety-critical systems.
Finds runtime bugs at compile time.
Integrates into the developer workflow so defects are caught early.
