Klocwork is a Static Code Analysis Tool used mainly in automotive, aerospace, embedded systems, and safety-critical software to detect defects, vulnerabilities, and compliance issues in C, C++, C#, Java, Python, and other languages before
runtime.
üîç What Klocwork Does

Static Code Analysis ‚Äî examines source code without executing it.

Detects:
Memory leaks, null pointer dereferences, Uninitialized var, Segmentation fault
Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds access
Concurrency issues (race conditions, deadlocks)
MISRA C/C++ and AUTOSAR C++14 rule violations
Security vulnerabilities (e.g., CWE, CERT)
Integrates with:
IDEs (Visual Studio, Eclipse, CLion)
Build systems (Make, CMake, Bazel)
CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps)
Generates detailed reports with code location, defect description, and remediation guidance.

üí° Why Automotive Teams Use It
Meets ISO 26262 (functional safety) compliance.
Ensures MISRA C/C++ adherence for safety-critical systems.
Finds runtime bugs at compile time.
Integrates into the developer workflow so defects are caught early.

In your QNX build directory:
2Ô∏è‚É£ Instrument Your Build: Klocwork needs to intercept all compile commands to create a project build specification.
# Clean build first
make clean
# Intercept build commands
kwinject --output kwinject.out make
This generates kwinject.out ‚Äî the build specification file.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Klocwork Project
kwbuildproject --url http://klocwork-server:8080 \
               --project my_adas_project \
               kwinject.out
Here:
my_adas_project = project name in Klocwork server
kwinject.out = build spec from step 2

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Analysis
kwaudit --url http://klocwork-server:8080 my_adas_project
This will:
Send results to the server
Allow viewing them in Klocwork Review Portal or IDE

5Ô∏è‚É£ Enable MISRA Compliance Checks
In Klocwork server:
Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Analysis Profile
Select MISRA C 2012 or MISRA C++ 2008 / AUTOSAR C++14
Save and re-run analysis.

3. Common Add-ons in Automotive
MISRA C/C++ checker ‚Äì for ISO 26262 compliance.
AUTOSAR C++14 checker ‚Äì for modern automotive codebases.
CI/CD Plugins ‚Äì Jenkins, GitLab, Azure DevOps integration.
